# Molecular Approaches to Clinical Microbiology in Africa
## 2â€“8 September 2023, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)

[Wellcome Connecting Science Course Website Link](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/event/molecular-approaches-to-clinical-microbiology-in-africa-20230902/) <br /> 

## Course overview

The wind of change is blowing through clinical microbiology, not just in Africa but across the globe. Molecular techniques are revolutionising the routine identification and characterisation of pathogens, opening new opportunities and challenges in all areas of clinical microbiology from clinical diagnostics to fundamental research. This course will examine the impact of molecular approaches in the African context using a combination of lectures and tutorials and laboratory and computer practical sessions. The course will focus on bacterial pathogens of importance in Africa.

The intensive programme will provide clinical microbiologists and laboratory scientists working in Africa with a concise yet comprehensive overview of the latest research and practice in this essential area, with an emphasis on how these techniques can be applied day-to-day in an African setting, especially when resources are limited. There will be extensive opportunity to interact with the course faculty during the course.

The course will concentrate on approaches which are:

- currently applicable in African laboratories.
- likely to be applicable in Africa in the foreseeable future, including whole genome sequencing (WGS) using portable devices.
- of value to participants in interpreting the literature and assessing the likely utility of new technologies as they are developed.

The course is aimed at those primarily trained in culture-based microbiology and combines an understanding of the latest research techniques and theoretical approaches, with practical methods to provide a foundation-level of understanding of the philosophy, methods, and specialist terminology of molecular techniques.

The week-long course will be held at, and in collaboration, with the [Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)](https://www.kemri.go.ke/). The course is free to attend and open to applicants based in institutes in Africa.
